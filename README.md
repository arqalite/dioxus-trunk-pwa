# dioxus-trunk-pwa
Example app for PWA functionality with Dioxus and Trunk.

## Building from source
In order to build the app, you need:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Rust WASM target (run `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) (you can get it with `cargo install trunk`)

Once set-up, run `trunk serve --open` and it should be good to go!
